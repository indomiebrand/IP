# StudyInc.

StudyInc. is an app designed specifically for Ngee Ann students with the aim to enhance their study habits through gamification. It also aims to be a way for students to communicate with each other to create a friendly environment where everyone knows each other, regardless of what course they're in.
 
## Design Process

As a student, I want to be able to study better so that I can enhance my learning performance in school.

I'm the type who doesn't have a lot of motivation to study, as some students are. However, I'm a big fan of games where they allow users to customize themselves. Thus, I had this idea of wanting to combine the idea that when students have successfully finished studying, they will earn an online currency where they can in turn use it to purchase avatar items to customize themselves, or furnitures to decorate their room.

## Features

There is only one current feature, and that is the Pomodoro  Timer. It's the main feature that is currently not in works and is too buggy. 

It essentially uses the concept of the Pomodoro Technique, where you identify a task that you need to complete, and allocate 25 minutes for yourself to do it. Then, you focus on that task with NO distractions at all, and when the time is up, you take a 5 minutes break. You do this until you're done with that task, then repeat it for any other task that you plan to finish. 

It is proven to be effective, and even I did it for myself once for a previous IP assignment.

The main part is that students are not allowed to close the app when the timer is running because they aren't suppose to be distracted when they're suppose to be doing their task. They are, however, allowed to lock their phones. 

During breaktime, they are allowed to use their phone but run the app in the background or else it won't be able to capture. 

It's a strict regime, but that's if you choose to do your tasks like this, and especially if you're prone to procastinating (like me..)

### Features Left to Implement
1. Room Customization
    - They can customize the following: Chair, Study Table, Bookshelf, Fridge
2. Avatar Customization
    - Students can customize their character's hair, skin tone, clothes, facial features and more
3. Earning currency after student has succesfully finished their task in the Pomodoro Timer
4. Stickie Note Feature
    - Other students can leave a stickie note on your fridge to send you messages
5. Forum:
    - Students can post topics regarding anything related to NP in the forum section
6. Leaderboard:
    - Acts as a motivation for students to perform better by displaying how many points they have, and ranking them based on that information


## Testing


1. Login Form:
    1. Go to login page (index.html)
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears and then go to the profile page.

Currently, the only responsive web page is the login and sign-up page. The profile page is also slightly respopnsive, but the scaling is a bit off for some elements.
